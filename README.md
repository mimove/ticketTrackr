# Ticket Trackr


## :thinking: What
This is a ticket tracker application that [@frkroe](https://github.com/frkroe) and [@mimove](https://github.com/mimove) are developing to get insights on the expenditure of different supermarkets. The first two that are going to be added are Mercadona and Consum.

## :trollface: Why?
We want to know how much we spend on groceries and how much we spend on each supermarket. We also want to know how much we spend on each product and how much we spend on each product category.

In addition, as we want to learn the state-of-the-art practices in data engineering, such as CI/CD, testing, and so on, we decided to develop this application.
